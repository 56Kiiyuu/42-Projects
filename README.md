# 42 Projects

This repository gathers my projects completed during the 42 curriculum.  
Each project has its own folder containing the source code and instructions.

## Projects

- **Libft** — My first C library, regrouping essential functions.  
- **ft_printf** — A custom implementation of the `printf` function with the main format conversions.
