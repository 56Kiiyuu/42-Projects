## About the Piscine

The **42 Piscine** is an intensive month-long coding bootcamp where students dive deep into programming — without teachers, without lectures, and with a strong focus on **autonomy, collaboration, and perseverance**.

During the Piscine, I learned to:

- Solve programming challenges using **C language** 🧠  
- Work independently and manage my own learning ⚙️  
- Collaborate with peers and share knowledge 🤝  
- Write clean, efficient, and well-structured code 💡
